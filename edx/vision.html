        <p class = "note">
            Our team of Network Engineers have what it takes to execute, 
            but it requires a strong culture of collaboration. We make it a priority to create a collaborative
            culture built on trust. When we can trust one another, we all can engage in less conflict around ideas 
            and commit to group plans of action, and when the group comes together there is nothing stopping us from 
            finding the best solutions to our clients toughest challenges.
