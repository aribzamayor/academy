        <p>The <em>Leopard</em> is awesome because its mode of communication is different from every other animal. it communicates, though hypothesized, with the white tips of its tail which functions as 'follow me' signal. however, no significant association were found between a conspicuous color ot the tail patches and behavioral variables in canivores. it can run at over<strong>58km/h(36mph)</strong>.</p>
