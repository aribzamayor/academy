		<p id="write_up">
			Is your organization prepared to implement widespread remote work to protect employees against coronavirus? Here's what you need to do.
			Is your enterprise IT organization smelling a little more like hand sanitizer these days? It's going around. As organizations in the US and around the world prepare for the advance of the coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, plenty of unknowns remain about the virus that has killed thousands around the world. Several US metropolitan areas have reported cases of the illness, and the spread can be tracked by this dashboard and map from Johns Hopkins. Public health officials are also tracking the spread, and the corporate world is proceeding with caution.<br>

			"When you walk into an event like this, there's a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt," said Rick Barr, Chief Operating Officer at OneLogin, an identity management and workforce access company that also helps customers with business continuity. That FUD is already changing how organizations do business.

			Several companies, including Apple, Amazon, Cargill, EY, Salesforce, and Twitter, have curtailed all but essential business travel. A number of big industry events have also been cancelled including Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Google Next and Adobe Summit are going digital only. The Game Developer Conference (which is owned by Informa, the same company that owns InformationWeek) is postponed.

			That's a lot of disruption for the technology industry and for most industries, especially since the virus has not spread very far in the US yet. Still, public health experts recommend keeping a "social distance" from other people of 3 to 6 feet. That's hard to do if you are wedged into an airplane seat, a keynote auditorium seat, an open-office workstation, or even one of those old-fashioned cubicles. That's probably why many companies are also allowing or even encouraging employees to work from home. In some cases, the directive to work from home is just if the employee is sick. In other cases, such as Twitter, all employees are being encouraged to work from home.

			Is your enterprise IT organization ready to support the entire workforce of your company working from home? Thanks to digital transformation and cloud computing, you probably already have migrated a lot of work to the cloud. You may also have collaboration tools in place such as chat software and video conferencing. Still, are you ready for the day your CEO tells everyone to work from home tomorrow?

			If you haven't prepared at all for such an event, it's a good idea to start with a team of maybe eight employees and tell them all to work from home starting tomorrow. That's according to John O'Duinn, author of the book Distributed Teams. O'Duinn is also a longtime software development leader who worked for the US Digital Service under the Obama administration as well as for multi-national organizations and non-profits. He currently works as a senior strategist for CivicActions.

			You want to make sure that this pioneering team has someone from the C-suite on it, so that there's someone who can override any bureaucratic bottlenecks to making it work, such as authorizing a software purchase.

			That team works from home for one day with each person doing their normal work. They interact with co-workers, clients, and partners. Use all the systems the company has set up.

			It's a good time to be an IT pro. The economy is strong. Unemployment is low. Plus, IT is not just a business cost center anymore. Tech is now core to business operations, creating value for customers, and more. With that in mind, here's the No. 1 question you should be asking yourself in 2020: Are you being paid what you are worth in today's booming market?

			This year is a great time for you, as a technology professional, to take a critical look at your value in the market and current compensation. Do you know what your peers are making in terms of salary and benefits? What skills will keep you in demand in the months and years ahead? Are you more likely to be successful in your search for a remote opportunity?

			Those are a few of the questions InformationWeek asks and answers in its 2020 IT Salary Report. The 2020 InformationWeek IT Salary Report is based on a survey of 800 IT professionals and leaders along with phone follow up interviews with an assortment of IT pros about their perspectives on trends in the market.

			If you are looking for a ballpark number, the median total compensation for IT pros climbed to <strong><em>$110,000</em></strong> in 2019, up from <strong><em>$105,000</em></strong> the year before. But that doesn't mean that everyone should have expected a <strong><em>$5,000</em></strong> raise. Half of IT pros reported receiving a total compensation increase of less than 5% in 2019. Anything higher than that was rarer.
